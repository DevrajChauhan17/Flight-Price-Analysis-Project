✈️ Flight Price Analysis Project

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing flight ticket pricing data to uncover trends, patterns, and cost-related insights across different airlines, flight durations, and travel timings.
Using Python and data visualization, the goal is to understand how various factors influence ticket prices and to categorize airlines based on pricing behavior.

🎯 Objectives

- Analyze average flight prices across airlines
- Study the impact of departure and arrival times on ticket pricing
- Examine the relationship between flight duration and price
- Identify airlines with high price variability
- Classify airlines into budget vs premium categories using visual analysis

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas – data cleaning & manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook – analysis and reporting

📊 Analysis & Visualizations

The project includes multiple visualizations such as:
- Bar charts for average airline pricing
- Box plots to analyze price variability
- Scatter plots for duration vs price analysis
- Time-based comparisons for departure and arrival trends
Each visualization addresses a specific business or customer-focused question.

📈 Key Insights

- Ticket prices vary significantly across airlines
- Flight duration has a noticeable impact on pricing
- Certain travel times tend to be more cost-efficient
- Airlines can be visually grouped into budget and premium categories
